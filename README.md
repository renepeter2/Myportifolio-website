Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. Map Embedding Confusion
Problem: The map did not display correctly in the intended section.
Solution: Used Google Maps' "Embed a map" feature to generate a valid iframe link and wrapped it in a responsive container to maintain layout integrity.

2. Responsive Layout Breaks
Problem: Content overflow and misaligned sections on smaller screens.
Solution: Implemented CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries to adapt content layout dynamically.

3. Script and Style Organization
Problem: Mixing logic and layout made updates and debugging difficult.
Solution: Separated JavaScript and CSS into dedicated external files and followed best practices for modular development.
