      <h2>Hello, I'm Rene Peter</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Rene Peter,I am a passionate web developer and multimedia student dedicated to creating visually appealing and functionally digital experiences. My journey into the world of technology began with a love for creativity, and a desire to communicate ideas that impact lives. I recently completed my training in web development at THE UNIVERSITY OF DODOMA, mastering core skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, along with a strong foundation in responsive and accessible design.

        With a Strong background in Graphic design and animation, I bring both technical expertise and a strong visual sense to every project I undertake. Whether it’s building a website, designing an interactive user interface, or editing a powerful worship video, I strive to ensure that the final result not only works efficiently but also connects emotionally with its audience.
        
        In addition to my work in tech, I’m also a dedicated gospel minister and a leader of worship team in my Fellowship. I use my digital skills to serve in ministry by creating promotional content, event videos, and online worship sessions. My faith inspires my work ethic, creativity, and commitment to excellence in everything I do.
        
        Here are some key areas I specialize in:
        
        Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation
        
        Design Tools: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Camtasia and After Effects
        
        Multimedia Production: Video editing, audio editing, animation
        
        Soft Skills: Team collaboration, effective communication, problem-solving
        
        I'm currently seeking opportunities to grow in a professional environment, apply my skills to real-world challenges, and continue learning alongside passionate and driven individuals. If you're looking for a creative mind with technical skills and a heart for service — I’d love to connect!.</p>
